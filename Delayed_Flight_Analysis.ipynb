More than half of that amount comes from passengers' pockets, as they do not only waste time waiting for their planes to leave, but also miss connecting flights, spend money on food and have to sleep on hotel rooms while they're stranded.\n",

For these reasons, the following analysis is highly relevant to the airline industry, as these insights can lead to major cost reductions. </font>"

The highest ratio of delays is Very Short Distance Category followed by Long Distance with 20.7 %. As we can see the top two ratios are the opposites regarding flight distance. Considering this it doesnt seem to be a strong correlation between delays and distance in a flight.\n",

    "The very short distance is the highest ratio of all categories this is due to the amount of flights in this category.\n",
    "NAS Delay has the highest delays compared to all 5 types of delays in very short distance. This is due to air traffic control on busy airports or traffic on take off. The longer the flight the less amount of delay it presents since you can make up time during longer flights to compensate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Delay has the highest ratio of all types in Short distance flights. As a passenger it seems you are most likely to see a security breach in general in this type of flights. A good thing about this type of delay is that is usually the shortest type of delay reagarding time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather Delay seems to be affect more in long distance flights in other categories it stays in the middle of the pack compared to all the other delay types. So the longer the flight the greater risk of running into a Weather Delay. Another thing to consider with Weather Delays is they produce the longest delays of all types.\n",
    "Late Aircraft Delay is present more in Very Short and Short distances compared to other types. this may be due to the amount of times a route is flown per day. In this short distance flights the same route can be flown during the same day producing delays towards the end on the day since all minimal delays add up. Also Late Aircraft Delays are the most common type of delay.\n",
    "Carrier Delay is the highest for Medium distance flights. You can expect this type of delay in flights that last between 2 and 3 hours of flight time. </font>"

What can explain that all type of delays occur more often?\n",
    "    \n",
    "One hypothesis we had is that is that on weekends the operations are more strained. Since flights is a tight knit transportation network with a lot of interdependencies, if flights start to get delayed it can cascade to the following flights. This can impact airline operations (CarrierDelay), airport operations (SecurityDelay) and control operations \n",

    "<br>The dataframe printed for reference shows that there are in total less flights on weekends (day 6 & 7) than on weekdays. This would make operations easier for all stakeholders involved. However, it can also be assumed that on weekends the personnel is reduced significantly. This information is not available in the dataset, but it can explain why on weekends all types of delays are longer on average. With less personnel, it is more challenging for each stakeholder to complete the tasks in time and less likely that they will catch up once they have fallen behind.\n",

    "\n",
    "<font color = blue> From our analysis we can conclude that the delay recovery is possible, but happens mostly in the short haul flights than in the long haul flights. This is very counter intuitive, because general expectation would be that if the distance of the journey is longer, there is more time for recovering the lost time. But that does not seem to happen so in this case. Instead of taking the absolute numbers for identifying whether long haul or short haul recovers faster, we took the proportion of short/long haul flights that have a departure delay > 0 and then took a ratio of the ones which have arrival delay lower than departure delay. This gives us a better estimate of the proportional recovery. </font>"
